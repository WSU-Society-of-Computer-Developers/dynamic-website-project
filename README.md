# Introduction

Hello everyone, my name is Zavaar Shah and I am the software lead here at SCD. Today I will be introducing our first software/web project. In this project, we will be creating our own dynamic website - dynamic in the sense that all data from the website will be taken from external services (APIs). We first start by creating a frontend (the part of the website users get to interact with) using HTML, CSS, and javascript. Then we will attach functionality to our frontend with client-side scripting. This may sound complicated at first, but believe me, it won't be once we walk through it. At the end of this project, you will have learned how to create your own website using HTML alongside giving your website functionality with free-public APIs. One of the main goals of this project will be to demonstrate how frontend(s) are created and meshed with backends-backends in our case are the free public APIs we are using. With this knowledge, we can build our own weather apps, social media clients, and other dashboard-esque/data-displaying websites.

# Schedule

Meeting times will be every Thursday from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM (or longer if needed) starting on September 8th and ending on September 29th. Two of these times will overlap with coding nights (09/15 and 09/29). We will code together for the most part, but if you want to work ahead it's totally up to you. In each meeting, we will try to complete an objective. Objectives will be released later once I gauge this project. The first objective will be to set up our code environment and start creating the skeleton of the front end - and we will do this together in our first meeting on September 8th.

# Required tools:

* Code editor, like [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* very basic javascript, HTML, and CSS syntax knowledge 
* an internet connection 

# Learning Objectives

* How frontends are built with backends (the part of the application the user doesn't get to see, i.e the server) in mind
* How frontends are built with user experience in mind
* Integrating APIs (application programming interfaces) to our frontend
* Javascript DOM, HTTP requests, HTML and CSS conventions
* Proper API wrapper implementation and organization


More details will be released soon, look for announcements in the discord for the full stack software project. Hope to see you there!
